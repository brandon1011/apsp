## Introduction
This is an implementation of a Statistical Algorithm for the "All Pairs Shortest Path" problem.
### Completed
* Auto-generation of Random Geometric Graphs 
* Best First method for finding All-Pairs shortest path using [Floyd Warshall Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)
* Union find data structure with path compression and union-by-rank
* Kruskall's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree
* Dijkstra's Algorithm for single source shortest path
* Feature generation
* Learning and predicting using Random Forest Regression

### To Do
* Perform tests to compare cost vs speed of Kruskall vs Floyd Warshall
* Implement workflow for building training data
* Infrastructure for predicting, building resulting subgraphs, then comparing results.
